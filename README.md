# mist-ap41-challenge-resolver

This is a C implementation of the SHA256 HMAC based challange of the mist AP 41 , for more information and how to access the serial terminal check https://github.com/neggles/mist-ap41.

From the device /etc/inittab file, we can see console_login attached to the console listining to the serial port:
```
# Put a getty on the serial port
console::respawn:/sbin/getty -l /bin/console_login -L console 0 vt100
```
At the console promt, console_login will present a base64 encoded SHA256 HMAC challenge, with an initial 'B'. If the setting developer=true is present in the uboot enviroment (uboot settings are stored on 24c64 eeprom), the challenge has the following structure:

D|5c-5b-35-2f-4f-b4|developer|16 bits random number

1. Type of challange, D (developer), A (answer)
2. Mac address, fields separated by '-'
3. Username, when developer=true in uboot enviroment, the user is always 'developer'
4. Random number, 16bits (0x10) random number, from device's /dev/urandom

console_login expects a base64 encoded answer with the following structure:

1. 16 bits random number (same as the challenge)
2. SHA256 HMAC digest of a specific message, with a key generated by another SHA256 HMAC digest using 16bits ot 0x400 address of the 24c68 eeprom of the device.
